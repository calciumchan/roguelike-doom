# roguelike-doom
roguelike mapset for zdoom.<br>
UNFINISHED BECAUSE MAPPING TAKES A LONG ASS TIME AND I NEED A LOT OF FUCKING MAPS TO MAKE THIS WORK PROPERLY<br>
uses handcrafted levels with set geomotry that can be altered in specific ways combined with randomized item and monster spawns to make semi unique levels every play session.<br>
this creates a more roguelike experience unlike oblige (not saying this is better than oblige). this streamlines the "roguelike" experience, automatically generating new random level orders and sending player to a starting lobby when they die.<br>
<br>
# features or some shit that ive used for testing:
+ no need to generate new levels each play session
+ progression system ups the difficulty and item spawns each level
+ night and day system
+ weather system
+ branching paths and altered level geometry
+ randomized level theming
+ automatically sends players back to the beginning when all players are dead, removing their inventory
+ highly compatible with most gameplay/monster mods
# mods that pair well with this shit:
+ corruption cards (kind of, i need to fix some shit with that)
+ complex doom
+ gmota
+ highnoon drifter i guess
<hr>
rldoom monsters is broken for some fucking reason, i think i know why. and corruption cards dont reset between runs heheheheheehheehheefjklahjksdfhj.<br>
also scumhead please make vomitoreum compatible with vanilla mapsets PLEASEEEEEE.<br>
